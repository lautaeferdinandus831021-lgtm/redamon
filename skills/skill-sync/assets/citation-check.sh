# Two modes, same grep, opposite intent:
#     citation-check.sh                 -> staged changes (git diff --cached)
#                                          used by the pre-commit hook
#     citation-check.sh <git-range>     -> that range (e.g. master...HEAD)
#                                          used by hand at branch-review time
#
# With no argument and nothing staged it prints nothing - that is correct.
