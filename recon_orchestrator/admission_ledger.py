"""
Memory-aware admission control for scan containers (Part 1 of the memory governor).

The orchestrator spawns scan jobs (full/partial recon, ai-attack, gvm, github,
trufflehog), each of which also spawns sibling tool containers. This ledger
decides whether there is room to start another one WITHOUT risking host OOM.

It reserves each job's expected peak (its "envelope"), not its current usage,
because containers allocate lazily: reading instantaneous free RAM would let many
jobs each see "plenty free" and then grow into a joint OOM. A job is admitted only
when its envelope still fits the scan pool AND live MemAvailable has headroom AND
we are not already in a critical-pressure state.

Pure and dependency-light (only resource_governor + stdlib) so it is unit-testable
without Docker. The mem/pressure sources are injectable for tests.
