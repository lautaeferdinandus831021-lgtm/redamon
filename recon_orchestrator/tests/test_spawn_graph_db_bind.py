"""Issue #169 - end-to-end guard on the /app/graph_db bind of a real spawn.

test_graph_db_mount.py covers the decision helper in isolation. This file drives
the ACTUAL ``start_partial_recon`` spawn path with a stubbed docker client and
inspects the ``volumes`` dict that would reach ``containers.run`` - so it fails if
the helper is correct but a spawn site stops using it, or starts passing the wrong
``baked_into_image``.

Partial recon is the path the bug was reported on: full recon wraps its graph
imports in try/except and merely stops writing to Neo4j in silence, while partial
recon crashes with
``cannot import name 'Neo4jClient' from 'graph_db' (unknown location)``.

No docker daemon is needed: docker.from_env is patched for the whole construction.

Run:  docker exec whitehat-recon-orchestrator sh -c 'cd /app && python -m unittest tests.test_spawn_graph_db_bind -v'
