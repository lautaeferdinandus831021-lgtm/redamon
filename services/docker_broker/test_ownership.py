"""E1 — broker operate-on-existing ownership gating.

Runs the broker against a MOCK upstream that answers GET /containers/<id>/json
with a marker label iff the id contains "owned", and asserts:
  * create injects the broker-owned marker label,
  * exec/attach/kill/archive on an UNLABELLED container -> 403, not forwarded,
  * the same verbs on a LABELLED container -> forwarded,
  * GET /containers/json is rewritten to force the ownership label filter.

Run: cd docker_broker && python3 test_ownership.py
