# Scan Timeline — end-to-end smoke test (docker compose)
# =============================================================================
# Drives the REAL endpoints against the REAL Postgres + Neo4j, as a logged-in
# user, and checks the whole loop the feature promises:
#
#   1. a project's live graph shows up as the current version (backfill)
#   2. "save current as a version" freezes it into stored snapshot bytes
#   3. viewing a PAST version returns the snapshot payload, NOT the live graph
#   4. mutating the live graph does not change the frozen version
#   5. activating the past version swaps the live graph back to it
#   6. agent (AttackChain) nodes are never captured and survive activation (F1)
#   7. Recon Delta compares two versions
#   8. deleting the current version is refused; a past one deletes with its bytes
#   9. cross-project version ids are 404 (BOLA), and unauthenticated access is 401
#
# Requires: docker compose up -d postgres neo4j webapp
# Usage:    tests/scan_timeline_smoke.sh
