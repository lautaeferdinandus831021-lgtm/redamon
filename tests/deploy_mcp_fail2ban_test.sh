# =============================================================================
# The [whitehat-mcp-auth] fail2ban filter, matched against real nginx log lines.
# Run:  bash tests/deploy_mcp_fail2ban_test.sh
#
# WHY: a fail2ban failregex fails in two directions and neither is visible on a
# running host. Too narrow and the jail never fires, so a token brute force is
# unpoliced while the jail sits there looking configured. Too broad and it bans
# a healthy MCP client for being rate-limited, or bans on a 401 from an
# unrelated endpoint. Nothing logs "your filter matched nothing", so the only
# way to know is to run the regex over lines nginx actually writes.
#
# The regex is read OUT of modules/fail2ban.sh rather than restated here, so
# editing the module without revisiting the corpus fails this test.
#
# The corpus carries each line twice: once as nginx writes it, and once with
# the timestamp blanked to `[]`, because fail2ban cuts the matched datetime out
# of the line before applying failregex (this is why the stock nginx-botsearch
# filter is written against `\[\]`). A regex that anchors on the date passes one
# form and silently fails the other.
#
# Only documentation-range addresses appear here (RFC 5737 / RFC 3849).
